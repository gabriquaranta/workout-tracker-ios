## Key Features

-   **Dynamic Workout Plans**:
    -   Create, edit, and delete custom workout plans.
    -   Clone existing workouts to quickly create new routines.
    -   Add exercises to any workout and define multiple sets with specific reps, weight, and rest times.
    -   Newly added sets automatically copy the values from the previous set, speeding up plan creation.

-   **Interactive Workout Sessions**:
    -   **Live Activities & Dynamic Island**: Your main workout timer and active rest timers are always visible on your Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island.
    -   A live in-app timer tracks the total session duration.
    -   Check off sets as you complete them with satisfying **haptic feedback**.
    -   An automatic rest timer starts after each set, with a system notification when time is up.

-   **Qualitative & Quantitative Tracking**:
    -   **Exercise Feedback**: Rate how each exercise felt using an emoji scale (ðŸ˜„ to ðŸ’€) and see how it compares to your last attempt.
    -   **Workout Notes**: After finishing, add session-specific notes (e.g., "Felt strong," "Low energy") that are saved to your workout log.

-   **Advanced Stats & History**:
    -   **Main Dashboard**: See your total completed workouts and total time spent working out at a glance on the main screen.
    -   **Performance Graphs**: View a graph of your **max single-set volume** (`reps * weight`) for each exercise over time.
    -   **Personal Records**: Track key PRs, including your max weight ever lifted and the corresponding reps for that lift.
    -   **Searchable History**: A detailed, date-sorted log of all completed workouts, including notes and feedback. The main stats screen has a search bar to quickly find any exercise.
    -   **Clear History**: Option to safely delete all workout history and stats without affecting your saved workout plans.

-   **Data Persistence**: Your workouts and history are automatically saved to the device, so your data is always there when you open the app.
